# FIRE FINDER

## INTRODUCTION

This repository contains all the code for my entry into the InnovateFPGA 2021/2022 design competition.  As there are a number of functional modules, each module is a distinct subtree within the repository.

Please refer to the README file within each subtree for an explanation of the module, and it's usage.
