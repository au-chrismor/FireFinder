# AUDIO PLOTTER

## Background

We can process and recognise audio files easily by converting them to images.  audio_plotter is the key to this step.

## Details

Using SciPy, audio_plotter reads the audio stream (in WAV format) and plots it using the standard MatPlotLib functions.  To improve recognition, all the usual decorations are removed.
